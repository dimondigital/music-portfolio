        "“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.oed.com/dictionary/eternity_n\">Eternity</a>, in common parlance, is an infinite amount of time that never ends or the quality, condition or fact of being everlasting or eternal. Classical philosophy, however, defines eternity as what is timeless or exists outside time, whereas sempiternity corresponds to infinite duration. ” (c) Wikipedia",
        "First of all, when I started to develop and write the soundtrack for the game on request of indie game developer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/466500/?snr=1_5_9__205\">«35mm»</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8MT689c3ppAc_2_YH0LEdA\">Sergei Noskov</a>, I with great enthusiasm immersed myself in listening and analyzing the references he asked to orient. It was the music of such a famous composer as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005949/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_5_in_0_q_Artemiev%2520Eduard\">Eduard Artemiev</a> for the films of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001789/\">Andrei Tarkovsky</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRDYpCmMcM\">«Stalker»</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8ZhQPaw4rE\">«Solyaris»</a>. In several compositions I tried to convey a similar atmosphere, even using digital imitations of the 80s' vintage synths.",
        "As for modern artists, I have already relied on my own tastes and preferences. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/carbonbasedlifeforms\">Carbon Based Lifeforms</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bandcamp.com/threesix\">36</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/astropilot\">Astropilot</a> and other artists of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/ambient/\">ambient</a> genre perfectly complemented the list of inspirations that convey an atmosphere of eternity and post-apocalyptic mood.",
        "My friend, an expert in electronic experimental music Sergei Grishin was a partner in the creation of several compositions. His experience in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/darkside/?__cf_chl_tk=Js26rUTKaEsGuQxkzfElMsZ8vokwWpRAmrj9SbUszl4-1734373045-1.0.1.1-CtdIab.kD8boJSywt5ANl6AH9.CDJXN4LTzm9KZkUjc\">darkside</a>  was very useful in creating music for the most disturbing moments of the game.",
        "But the main inspiration of course I got from Sergei Noskov’s own game. Screenshots from the game and other photos and whole albums that Sergei shared with me."

Chaos erupted as the beats danced in wild and unpredictable patterns, leaving Pixel flabbergasted. But instead of getting frustrated, they embraced the mishap and turned it into a collaborative masterpiece.",

As they hit the climax of their composition, their pixelated world came alive with vibrant colors and quirky characters dancing to the infectious tune.",

It was a reminder that even in the world of technology, embracing mistakes and finding the beauty in unexpected moments could lead to the creation of something truly unique and magical."

With a quick rearrangement, Byte turned the flowers into a pixelated smiley face, making Nano burst into laughter.",
